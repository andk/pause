  <h3>Short version</h3>

  <p>
    Over the years I have found the following methods of logging out.
    None of them is guaranteed to work. Different browsers fail in
    different ways at different versions. <b>Please verify that you
    are effectively logged out by your browser.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    You may need to click on <i>Cancel</i> when your browser asks you
    to login.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a class="menuitem" href="authenquery?logout=1__RANDOMSTRING__">
        Redirect with Cookie
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="menuitem" href="authenquery?logout=2__RANDOMSTRING__">
        Redirect to Badname:Badpass@Server URL
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="menuitem" href="authenquery?logout=3">
        Quick direct 401
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Long version</h3>

  <p>
    PAUSE currently uses the <i>Basic Authentication Scheme</i>
    according to the HTTP specification. This means that your browser
    sends your username and password with every request to the server.
    In that sense you are never logged into the server as in telnet or
    ftp connections. Every request is made independently from all
    previous requests and in that sense there is no concept of logging
    out. However, the user usually <i>perceives</i> the dialog as a
    session that is equivalent to a telnet or ftp session. But PAUSE
    does nothing to support this concept.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a matter of fact, as long as your browser remembers your userid
    and password, it will send the associated HTTP header to PAUSE and
    PAUSE will answer the request. Browsers handle the cache of
    authentification data differently. If you want your browser to
    forget them, most browsers require you to shut the browser down.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, Netscape 4 had the convenient behaviour that if the
    server sent a status code of 401 (HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED), it presented
    the user with a new login dialog. This dialog could be used to
    login with a different name and different password. If the
    different name and password were bogus, this method allowed you to
    effectively <i>log out</i>, in the sense that a new authentication
    was required to talk to PAUSE. Other browsers behave differently.
    As a consequence you can still visit PAUSE after that without
    having to type in username and password, so these browsers can not
    be tricked into forgetting the credentials. You have been warned.
    Please try the above three methods and see what happens. Please
    verify that your browser behaves as you want it to.
  </p>

  <p>
    If, on the other hand, you're just interested to see how PAUSE
    looks like for not authenticated users, please <a class="menuitem"
    href="query">click here</a>. This brings you to a different
    <i>realm</i> on PAUSE that doesn't need authentication. If you go
    there, your browser will not forget your username and password.
