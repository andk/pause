            mldistwatch (the indexer) now parses $VERSION with the help of CPAN::Version which is included in CPAN.pm. The effect is that modules that use v-strings for $VERSION get indexed better, e.g. diagnostics.pm now is indexed with version <b><code>v1.0</code></b> instead of <b><code>undef</code></b>.

      <dt><b>2000-10-15</b></dt>
      <dd><ul><li>PAUSE gets new hardware: Athlon 700 and 2x20 GB IDE disks,
            mostly RAID1 mirrored. Linux kernel is 2.2.18pre15 and distribution is
            RedHat 6.2. Installed software has hardly changed to make transition
            more secure.</li></ul></dd>

      <dt><b>2000-10-13</b></dt>
      <dd><ul><li>As our sponsor Speedlink is moving, PAUSE is relocated too from
            Dircksenstrasse to Hardenbergplatz. Thanks to the whole team that made
            the move in just a few hours with not a single incident.</li></ul></dd>

      <dt><b>2000-06-23</b></dt>
      <dd><ul><li>After reading on bugtraq about yet another root compromise of
            wuftpd, I killed it and replaced it with proftpd version 1.2.0pre10.</li></ul></dd>

      <dt><b>2000-05-23</b></dt>
      <dd><ul><li>During the last two weeks the whole directory tree below
            authors/id/ has got a cosmetic operation. All directories are now
            living in depth 2, i.e. ANDK/ has now been moved to A/AN/ANDK/ and the
            old directories are now symlinks to the new ones. The reasons for this
            were: Doing it this way opens at least the option to deprecate the
            symlinks in the future. And by deprecating them we can some day really
            get rid of them. And anyway, if we make the canonical name the same as
            the real filename we avoid confusion for future implementors (i.e. for
            anybody who does some programming related to the CPAN). And there is
            the effect of generating a two class community: I have been asked
            already if I could "pretty please" assign such a "real" CPAN ID to a
            new user instead of a second class one:-/</li></ul></dd>


      <dt><b>2000-04-02</b></dt>
      <dd><ul><li>Added the action <a href="/pause/authenquery?ACTION=add_mod"
              >add_mod</a> to the admin menu. It's a page that speeds up registering
            a new module considerably and what is more important, makes more
            teamwork possible.<br />The Todo list is untouched since December and
            new demands pop up: Change the site/URL layout to be more natural, add
        pages to apply for registration of both developers and modules,
        improve security of the whole CPAN, invent something to slurp the Tk,
        Apache, and XML module lists, prepare yourself for the first module
        with vX.X.X style numbering, balanced directory structure in the
        authors/id directory, etc, etc. But above all this is the desire to
        catch up with tons of messages that have remained unanswered.</li></ul></dd>

      <dt><b>2000-02-04</b></dt>
      <dd><ul><li>Creation of the backpan (not even a working title). It's the
            seed for a project of the history of the PAUSE where all uploads of
            all times are kept. See ftp://p11.speed-link.de/pub/backpan/README</li></ul></dd>


      <dt><b>2000-01-06</b></dt>
      <dd><ul><li>Upgrade to linux-2.2.14, wu-ftpd-2.6.0.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-12-09</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>My current Todo list is mostly unchanged since October:
UTF8-ification, trigram search for authors and modules which directs
to a page with item-related menues, per-author inventory page, fix
false positives in mldistwatch and mail the reports to the authors,
open perms table, arbitrary voting ala Slashdot, make more error
conditions visible via web interface. Longer term: Date/Time chapter
and flexibility to add more chapters (e.g. symlink tree washer).</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-12-09</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>In addition to the old 4GB disk PAUSE gets my spare 9GB disk.
Indended use: public archive of all authors directories starting with
day zero (i.e. as if no deletions had ever happened).</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-26</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Entry page now has short blurb about all available menu items,
both for users and admins.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-25</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Mailinglist representatives now supported (beta).</li></ul></dd>

  <dd><ul><li>Repair tool for unsuccessful uploads now available (beta).</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-22</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Bugzilla declared inappropriate for PAUSE. Closed the Bugzilla
tables by dropping database "bugs" after making a backup.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-21</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Module list catchup <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-10/msg00903.html">posting</a>.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-20</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Edit module form now available for authors.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-10-19</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Installation of a form that lets at least people with admin
privileges edit the <i>mods</i> table of the database directly. At the
same time the scripts to produce a new module list have been made
lighter and use the modulelist template only for formatting and
sequence hints. This revolutionary step was inspired by Kurt
Starsinnic during the Perl Conference 3. I've uploaded the very last
module list that was produced by the old scripts, version 2.58.
There's still a lot of work to do to make the form usable for the
authors, but we have a step forward.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-08-31</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Installation of a passwordmailer. Users can now lose their
password and aren't locked out.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-08-07</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>PAUSE database switches to mysql.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-08-05</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>PAUSE has a <a href="/pause/">new interface</a>. 80% of the old
stuff seem to be ported and the core of the old scripts has
redirectors to the new style.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-07-04</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Loic Dachary installs <a href="/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a>.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-07-03</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Andreas K&ouml;nig and Loic Dachary roll up their virtual
sleeves to start improving PAUSE. They rewrite the schema of the
database to fit as good as possible for both mSQL and mysql for an
easier transition path.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-05-17</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Upgrade to perl5.00556, apache 1.3.6, modperl 1.19-dev,
openssl-0.9.2b, Ben-SSL 1.34.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt><b>1999-04-23</b></dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Upgrade to Linux 2.2.6. Security checked with
nessus-alpha2-fix3.</li></ul></dd>


  <dt><b>1999-02-15</b></dt>
  <dd>Up to apache-1.3.4, mod_perl-1.18, Ben-SSL-1.31. Perl untouched.</dd>

  <dt><b>1998-12-22</b></dt>
  <dd>Better luck with Ben-SSL 1.29. SSL server up again. I don't know
what was it that was misconfigured.</dd>

  <dt><b>1998-12-20</b></dt>
  <dd>PAUSE moves to speed-link.de, my future
employer who is sponsering a 2 MBit line. The new machine is an AMD
K6-2/300 with 128M memory and a 4GB disk. As it has an UW SCSI
controler, it will be easy enough to add a bigger disk in a year or
so. While moving I upgraded to perl5.005_54 with apache 1.3.3, mod_ssl
2.1.2, and mod_perl 1.16_03-dev. SSL didn't work with the setup. </dd>

  <dt><b>1998-09-21</b></dt>
  <dd>Apache upgrade: now perl5.005_51 with
apache-1.3.1 with Ben-SSL 1.24 with mod_perl 1.15_01. Finally we're
running with the gcache enabled and hopefully will enjoy the speedup.<br />

For the future I'm planning to make pause.perl.org a CA. I'm not yet
sure what's the best upgrade path to achieve that. It seems to need
yet another name for PAUSE, but it's possible that this name will last
for a longer time than those of its predecessors. Suggestions from SSL
pros welcome. Thanks!</dd>

  <dt><b>1998-06-03</b></dt>
  <dd>PAUSE has a new home. The old server was a
68040 NeXT 25 MHz which started to behave peculiarly. It was both slow
and a risk. The new machine is a 100MHz 486 Linux machine. Not a
thrill, but it should do for the job for a while. What matters more
than performance is that I do not have to port so much software to the
box, because I have all the things I need easily available.<br />

A necessary side effect of the relocation is a new SSL certificate.
This time I was clever enough to let it expire in &gt;10 years from
now. I hope this works out well.<br /> 

I apologize to all those who had to wait for quite a while to be
registered, I hope all future requests can be served within 3 days. If
we cannot manage that, we definitely need a new approach, but I'm
quite positive that we can make registering easier and faster.</dd>

Authentification handler now case-insensitive, so users may log in as
lwall instead of only LWALL. This was the most prominent mistake

All scripts are now available both as traditional CGI scripts and as
mod_perl scripts. On PAUSE the /perl/ directory is just a symlink to
the /cgi-bin/pml/ directory. So the traditional and the mod_perl
scripts are identical. Most scripts here on PAUSE require a password,
but if you have no password, I have prepared a simple read-only
example for you. Here is one and the same script

<ul>
  <li>running slow as <a
href="/cgi-bin/pml/who_is">traditional CGI</a>,</li>
  <li>running fast as <a
href="/perl/who_is">Apache::Registry subroutine</a>.</li>
  <li>Read the <a href="/modulelist/who_is">source code</a>.</li>
</ul>

You should be aware that this is running on a 25 MHz Motorola NeXT
over a 64k link, so you may not see a big difference.</dd>
