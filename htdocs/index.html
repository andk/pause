            The registered modules list is being retired.  The module list (aka
            <tt>03modlist.data</tt>) stored a curated list of modules with some
            metadata.  It has been superseded by metadata stored in the
            <tt>META.json</tt> file.  Module registration once provided a means
            to get feedback before uploading a new distribution.  This advice
            can now be gotten at <a href='http://prepan.org/'>PrePAN</a>.
            The module list will cease to contain any module data on or about
            April 1, 2014.

            Pause has been moved to pause2.develooper.com. Thanks to
            the help from Ask and Robert we found a new home for the
            server. At this point I'd like to thank the generous folks
            at fiz-chemie.de for their great support over nine
            years. There was really no reason to leave the cosy place
            but that I felt it would be time to bring the box to a new
            continent. And closer to the home of perl. Thank you, both
            old and new hosts.

            Jesse Vincent sends us a valid five-year SSL certificate
            from RapidSSL. This resolves a long standing misbehaviour
            of some versions of the Google Chrome Browser that made it
            hard for the end user to disable the warning Chrome gives
            if a security certificate is not trusted. Thank you,
            Jesse.

            RJBS and DAGOLDEN meet for a hackathon leading to a <a

            commits</a>. Today the result is deployed to the live
            pause, the first upload after the switch was

            This is running with perl 5.12.0-RC5. If this survives the

            At the Vienna QA Hackathon we're discussing some old hats
            that seem to be cast in stone forever and one is the
            notification email that is sent immediately after every
            upload request. We'll stop sending these because they seem
            to be irrelevant nowadays: in practice every upload
            succeeds and the user gets the information about success
            only one minute later or so. So expect from now on only
            one email per developer upload and two emails for stable
            uploads.

            Pause gets a new IP address. First I forgot that there was
            the old IP address hardcoded in the bind-address variable
            in my.cnf. This caused mysql not to start. What's worse,
            after that I didn't notice that DNS was not working. This
            allowed uploads to take place but they all hung during the
            first step that required DNS and this prevented all
            uploads to succeed. Fortunately they were not dropped but
            just in a retry loop. As soon as the DNS problem was
            fixed, the jam dissolved. So all Friday uploads got a
            considerable delay, I'm sorry for that.
