=head1 NAME

PAUSE - Perl Authors Upload Server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

IMPORTANT: THIS DOCUMENT IS OVER 10 YEARS OUT OF DATE.  MORE RECENT
DOCUMENTATION IS AVAILABLE IN the doc DIRECTORY.

This module is the code that runs L<http://pause.cpan.org/>, a server dedicated
to collect the work of perl authors worldwide.  It provides personal directories
and enables their owners to upload their work into that directory themselves.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Class overview

The methods C<alert()> and C<verbose()> exist in all classes. Only the two
in PAUSE::mldistwatch do something for real, the others just pass
their arguments up the "stack" of objects. Similarly index_status
passes arguments up till they reach the PAUSE::dist object. From there
they are harvested in the C<mail_summary()> method that sends a report to
the owner of the package

=head3 L<PAUSE::mldistwatch>

Mediates between the database and disk-based distributions.

=head3 L<PAUSE::mldistwatch::Constants>

Constants used for C<PAUSE::dist::index_status()>.

=head3 L<PAUSE::dist>

One distro.

=head3 L<PAUSE::pmfile>

One *.pm file in a distro.

=head3 L<PAUSE::package>

One package statement within a L<PAUSE::pmfile>.

=head2 Excluded files

The following file has been excluded from the repository for obvious
reasons:

    PrivatePAUSE.pm

PrivatePAUSE.pm contains only the usernames and passwords of the mysql
users that own the two databases. See below for "Database schema".

Other sensitive files, like the SSL key of the server, password files
need to be maintained separately from the repository. See below the
section about user management.

=head2 Cronjob table for PAUSE

The repository has a file CRONTAB.ROOT which is usually quite in sync
with the real pause.

=head2 Database schema

See F<doc/mod.schema.txt> and F<doc/authen_pause.schema.txt> for schema
of PAUSE's two databases.

A dump of the mod database is produced every few hours and available
for download in the rsync area (pause.perl.org::pausedata). A dump of
the authen_pause database is -- of course -- not available.

=head2 Other security considerations

We practice security by visibility by giving the users as much
information as possible about the status of their requests. This is
mostly done by sending them mail about every action they take.

Another important axiom is that we disallow overwriting of files
except for pure documentation files. That way the whole CPAN cannot
fall out of sync and inconsistencies can be tracked easily. It opens
us the possibility to maintain a I<backpan>, a backup of all relevant
files of all times. Any attempt to upload malicious code can thus be
tracked much better.
