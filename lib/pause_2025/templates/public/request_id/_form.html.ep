Note: You can enter fairly free-form text here but it must consist of at least two space-separated words. This is a spam protection measure we discovered accidentally. Back when PAUSE was developed in the nineties, people would generally fill out a field asking for a full name with a first name and a second name, like <i>Ben Cartwright</i> or <i>Tony Nelson</i>. When this trivial expectation was coded into the server as a sanity check, it turned out to block many spam bots because they often did not try to enter a space in the middle of the field. It was only around 2003 that people started complaining that they had tried <i>Peter</i> and it did not work. Apologies for insisting, Peter â€“ but feel free to make something up to satisfy the requirement.
