Things I hope to have done at PTS and afterwards:

- Finish porting pause_1999::fixup
- Write more tests, especially using latin-1 (and Asian/Emoji) characters
- Replace "require ..." with "use ..." to preload
- Move lib/pause_2017/t/ directory into t/ when tests are ready for travis.ci
- Wrap <%= %> stuff with <span class="..."> to make them easier to find/test (by Mech/Web::Scraper etc)
- Port spurious warn and print STDERR to ->log(level => "debug", ...)
- Replace YAML::Syck with something else
- Kill PAUSE::Web::Exception where appropriate, most of which can be replaced with return + $pause->{some_flags} + template blocks
- Add csrf_token where necessary (using Mojolicious::Plugin::WithCSRFProtection, maybe. add_uri shouldn't have it yet)
- Consider removing/replacing some plugins
- Replace XHTML with HTML5 if time permits, to remove a dirty hack on TagHelpers
- Incorporate fixes that have been merged to Andreas' master

Things that'll take more time to address (to avoid double encoding etc):

- Replace PAUSE::Web::Util::Encode with plain Encode
- Replace $mgr->fetchrow with $sth->fetchrow_*

Things that need discussion

- It would be nice if we can directly use some of the paused/mldistwatch features in the web UI tests 
- Pagers and table sorters, to make frequent uploaders (probably) happy
