    You're probably here to check whether things are working, or to deploy
    and update to PAUSE.  For more information on doing this stuff, check the
    docs: https://github.com/andk/pause/tree/master/doc

    They're not thorough yet, but they will get better.

    To act as the pause user, remember to run: sudo -u pause -i
